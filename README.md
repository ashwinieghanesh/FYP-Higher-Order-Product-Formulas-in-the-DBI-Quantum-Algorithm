# FYP-Higher-Order-Product-Formulas-in-the-DBI-Quantum-Algorithm

This repository is dedicated to my honors year thesis in Nanyang Technological University Singapore. My supervisors Dr. Marek Gluza and Dr. Koh Teck Seng have helped me make this project come into fruition. 
This work is a direct extension to my supervisor's original work on the double-bracket iteration quantum algorithm: arXiv:2206.11772 [quant-ph]
